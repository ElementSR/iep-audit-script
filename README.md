IEP Audit Script created to automate weekly data auditing
=======
What it does:
- Takes data extracted from school database and creates master Excel sheet by expanding compiled single column from extract
- Sorts and groups students by unique code
- Counts number of learning sessions
- Summarises existence and status of IEP goals
- On a regular basis, can re-extract data with updated date range and run script again. Script will retroactively update data in old rows, and append new data where required.


Updates

1.0 20/05/25:
